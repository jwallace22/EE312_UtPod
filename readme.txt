This is the readme file for the UtPod programming assignment for EE312.
Written by Jeffrey Wallace 11/01/2019

To run the UtPod program after the folder is unizpped:

1. type "module load gcc" into the command window
2. type "make"
3. run the program with "./UtPodTest"

There is a playlist1.txt file that contains a list of songs in the form of "artist title size" with no spaces in each instance.
This file can be altered to test different cases of the driver program.
